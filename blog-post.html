                   <p> <br>Wherever we go, whatever we see, data plays a major role in every aspect. A huge amount of data is present in this world. These data are analyzed and made into useful information only when we apply our mathematical and scientific knowledge to it. 

                   </p><p> The demand for data scientists has been constantly expanding. This is the reason why I'm giving more Importance to Data Science. Here, I'll share my experience and interests in Data Science and it’s current affairs. Further, I will insist a lot about its technical influence on people.  
                     </p><br><br>
                    <b>What made me passionate towards Data Science? </b><br><br>
                    <p>Well! I'm really excited to answer this question. All my eagerness was started when I was selected as a Data Science intern at Innomatics Research Labs, Hyderabad. Before a year, I have been searching for an internship related to my career. Finally, I've got an opportunity to gain my skills in Data Science and currently I'm working as an intern in this field. I have been learning a lot about Data Science and its fundamentals.  It's really interesting and I fascinate to learn the various technologies used in Data Science. I've been completely dived into this field only because of my internship and interest in it. This is the reason why I'm choosing Data Science as my career path.

<b>What is Data Science? <br> 
What's the role of Data scientist in our digital world?  <br>
Why this field is very essential in our career? <br> </b><br>

<p>It's really difficult to believe that nearly 70% of people in this world are raising these questions. Many people were not aware about Data Science and how & why we are implementing Data Science in various fields. This made me to develop my interest towards this particular field.</p><p> That's why I have been imparting some details and facts about Data Science. Now I would like to answer the above questions so that you can imbibe some knowledge on Data Science. By chance, it may also trigger up your interest in Data Science. </p> 
<br><br><b>What is Data Science?</b><br><br>
<p>Before getting into Data Science, we should know about data. Data is nothing but the facts and statistics collected together for analysis. 
Great! Now we'll move onto Data Science.</p><p> In my opinion, Data Science means designing a new process for data modeling and production. In simple words, Data Science is about drawing useful conclusions from large and diverse data through prediction. It includes finding solutions to a specific problem. Data Science has multidimensional scope and roots in all industries. 
It has scientific techniques like statistics, machine learning [also known as artificial intelligence (AI)] and mathematics under one umbrella to solve the complex problems. It gives you insights into the emerging trends in a specific model with the help of data that is being analyzed. 
 </p><br>

 <b>What's the role of Data scientist in our digital world? </b> <br><br>

<p>Data Scientists act as the decision manufacturers and are mostly accountable for analyzing and handling an oversized quantity of unstructured and structured information. Thus, they need numerous tools and programming languages to fix the day within the approach they required.</p>
<p> Most of the data scientists in the industry have advanced training in statistics, math and computer science. Their experience is a vast horizon that also extends to data visualization and data mining.
</p><br><br>
<b>Why this field is very essential in our career? </b><br><br>
<p>I've heard about the fact that Data Science has emerged out as one of the most popular fields of 21st Century. Industries impart the knowledge to Data Scientists to assist them in gaining insights on the market and to develop their products. </p>
<p>Today, organizations are opening their doors to data analytics - increasing the value of data science. It has become a universal truth that modern businesses are washed with data. Thus, it is becoming clear by the day that there is enormous value in data processing and analysis and that is where a data scientist steps into the spotlight 
</p><br><br>


<b>The importance of Data Science techniques in Industries:</b> <br><br>
 

<p>Data science is additionally taking part in the growing industries and it’s really a necessary role in the development of computing and machine learning. Many industries are turning to the latest version of systems that allow them to use large amounts of data.</p>
<p> Algorithms that are used to find the connections will help the organizations to reach their goals. Machine learning has immense potential across a number of industries and will undoubtedly play a huge role in how businesses are run in the future. Alright! I hope that you've gained some insights about Data Science.

 <br><br>

<b>Conclusion: </b> <br><br>
 <p>Data science is new, and we are still working on it. It is imperative that only less majority of students are showing their interest in Data Science. They should begin today to consider how to best prepare for and keep pace with this data-driven era of tomorrow.
